- [ ] I have searched the [issue list](https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll/issues)
- [ ] I have read the [limitations](https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll#limitations) and [feature status](https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll#feature-status) sections of the README.

Is this a bug in Gojekyll's Liquid template engine? If so, it would better reported, with a Liquid test case, [here](https://github.com/osteele/liquid/issues). If you aren't sure, go ahead and report it against Gojekyll, I'd rather have extra bug reports than not know.

#### System information

Liquid version: `gojekyll version`
Commit hash: (if version = `develop`)

#### Expected behavior


#### Actual behavior


#### Steps to reproduce the behavior

Provide the highest of these that is practical:

1. A Go test case. You're a hero!
2. A single file that demonstrates the problem. Put this in a directory and run `gojekyll -s path/to/directory`, and we'll see the issue.
3. A two-file site that demonstrates the problem. Put the `_config.yml` and the other document in a directory, etc.
4. A link to a repo that demonstrates the problem.
5. Something is wrong but I don't have time or knowledge to fully isolate it. Here's the best description I can provide.
