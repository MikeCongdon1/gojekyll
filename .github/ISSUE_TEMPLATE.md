## Steps to reproduce the behavior

Provide the first of these that is practical:

2. A single file that demonstrates the problem. Put this in a directory and run `gojekyll -s path/to/directory`, and we'll see the issue.
3. A two-file site that demonstrates the problem. Put the `_config.yml` and the other document in a directory, etc.
4. A link to a repo that demonstrates the problem.
