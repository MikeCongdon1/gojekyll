# Go Jekyll

When I grow up, I want to be a golang implementation of Jekyll.

## Status

I'm writing this to learn my way around Go. It's not good for anytihng yet, and it may never come to anything.

## Install

```bash
go get
```

## Run

```bash
go run *.go --source test build
go run *.go --source test serve
```
